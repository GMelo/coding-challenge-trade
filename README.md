Order Book Coding Assignment
An exchange allows the buyers and sellers of a product to discover each other and trade. Buyers and sellers (traders) submit orders to the exchange and the exchange applies simple rules to determine if a trade has occurred. The dominant kind of exchange is a central limit order book (CLOB) where orders are matched using ‘price time priority’.
